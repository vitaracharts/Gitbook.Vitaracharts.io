# Animation Duration

## The Power of Animation in Charts:&#x20;

In Modern's data-driven world, effective visualization is crucial for deriving insights and making informed decisions. Chart animations bring a dynamic and innovative touch to data representation by incorporating motion.

This option is available for series, particularly in chart types that support series-specific animations, such as:  Column , Bar , Sparkline  ,Line , Area  , Tornado , Stacked column  , Stacked bar.&#x20;

## The Impact of Charts on Data Visualization:

Users can customize the animation duration to fit their preferences, either speeding up or slowing down animations as needed. This flexibility is especially useful when working with large datasets, as it allows for improved performance and optimized load times through adjustable speeds.

By default, the animation duration is set to **1001ms**, but users can modify it as required. For example, setting the duration to **1ms** effectively disables animations, enabling faster chart renderingâ€”an essential feature for handling large datasets efficiently.

Additionally, users can customize the animation duration for individual series or apply a uniform duration (e.g., 1ms) across all series, ensuring the best possible performance for their specific use case.

### Introducing Animation Duration in Angular Gauge Chart

Starting from version **5.3.4**, an **Animation Duration** option has been introduced in the **Angular Gauge** Chart. This feature allows users to customize the duration of the animation, providing flexibility to tailor the chart's visual experience based on specific requirements.&#x20;

This option is available in the Gauge tab of the Property Editor. Please refer to the screenshot below for more details.
