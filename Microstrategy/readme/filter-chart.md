# Filter Chart

As of version 5.1.2, the Vitara Filter Chart has been added to our collection of Vitara charts. The main function of this chart is to control the play animation of multiple charts by selecting them with the target visualization. The animation speed can be changed by rotating the settings cog wheel to the right of the seek line.

Click on the empty available space under the filter chart to return to the usual view for all charts. 1 Attribute and 1 Measure are required. Eligible charts include metric and attribute drop zone maps. The following example shows how a single filter chart can manage a grid, pie chart, and word cloud.
