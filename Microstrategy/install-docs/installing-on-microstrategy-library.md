# Installing on MicroStrategy Library

## Download <a href="#download" id="download"></a>

* Download the **library version** of VitaraCharts.
* You can find the latest links for download from our download site at [Main page](https://www.vitaracharts.com/ms-product-downloads)

## Steps <a href="#steps" id="steps"></a>

* This VitaraChartsLibrary zip file will contain a folder named “VitaraCharts” and a separate folder for each of the visualizations.
* Unzip the ‘VitaraChartsLibrary’ zip file, you will get around 30+ folders.
* Stop​ WebServer (IIS/Tomcat or equivalent)
* Delete VitaraCharts related folders under MicroStrategy library plugins directory (if any exist).
* **Please ​do not**​ keep any backup copies of VitaraCharts in the plugins directory
* Copy over all the folders extracted from “VitaraChartsLibrary” zip file into the plugins folder of your MicroStrategy library installation. For instance if library server is installed under _c:\tomcat\webapps\MicroStrategyLibrary_, you will place all folders under _c:\tomcat\webapps\MicroStrategyLibrary_\​**plugins**

* **MicroStrategy 2021 Update 4 and newer versions**\
  From MicroStartegy 2021 update 4 version we can edit dossiers in the web library. So you have to provide license file in the library deployment also. REPLACE the license.txt file in the _webapps/MicroStrategyLibrary/plugins/VitaraCharts/_ folder with the license file provided to you.
* Start​ the WebServer.
* Flush any browser caches and access the dossier/documents from a new browser window (to avoid any issues with a previously used license file)
