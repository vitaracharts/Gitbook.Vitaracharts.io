* This VitaraChartsLibrary zip file will contain a folder named ‚ÄúVitaraCharts‚Äù and a separate folder for each of the visualizations.
* Unzip the ‚ÄòVitaraChartsLibrary‚Äô zip file, you will get around 30+ folders.
* Stop‚Äã WebServer (IIS/Tomcat or equivalent)
* Delete VitaraCharts related folders under MicroStrategy library plugins directory (if any exist).
* **Please ‚Äãdo not**‚Äã keep any backup copies of VitaraCharts in the plugins directory
* Copy over all the folders extracted from ‚ÄúVitaraChartsLibrary‚Äù zip file into the plugins folder of your MicroStrategy library installation.

* **MicroStrategy 2021 Update 4 and newer versions**\
  From MicroStartegy 2021 update 4 version we can edit dossiers in the web library. So you have to provide license file in the library deployment also. REPLACE the license.txt file in the _webapps/MicroStrategyLibrary/plugins/VitaraCharts/_ folder with the license file provided to you.
* Start‚Äã the WebServer.
* Flush any browser caches and access the dossier/documents from a new browser window (to avoid any issues with a previously used license file)
