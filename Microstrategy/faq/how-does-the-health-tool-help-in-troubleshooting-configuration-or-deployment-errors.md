# How does the Health Tool help in troubleshooting configuration or deployment errors?

&#x20;The Health Tool provides a centralized interface to detect and highlight issues related to plugin deployment, file integrity, version compatibility, and custom configurations. It uses visual indicators (such as error, warning, and suggestion icons) to help users quickly identify and resolve problems.

For detailed steps and explanations, please refer to the [Health Tool ](../install-docs/health-tool.md)Guide.
