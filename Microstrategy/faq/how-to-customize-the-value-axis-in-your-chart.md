**Example:**

The tick interval is like the spacing between marks on a ruler. For instance, if your data ranges from 0 to 20 million, you might set the tick interval to 2 million. This means you will see marks at intervals of 2 million units (0, 2M, 4M, 6M, …, 20M). Adjusting the tick interval based on your data’s range ensures that the chart remains clear and easy to read.
