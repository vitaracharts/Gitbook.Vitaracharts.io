### License

On MicroStrategy Desktop and Workstation we no longer enforce license validation. So use of VitaraMaps is freely permitted on these applications.

“Ensure there are no existing or old build files in your local machine’s Workstation folder. Delete any such files completely before deploying a new build in Workstation.”

**"C:\Program Files\MicroStrategy\Workstation\Code\plugins”**

(**Note**: The path may vary depending on the operating system or version.)

## Deployment Steps

There are two ways to deploy in Offline Mode:

### Connected to MicroStrategyLibrary Server

When using MicroStrategy Workstation in Connected to Environment mode, the VitaraMaps plugin must be installed both on the MicroStrategy Library Server and on your local Workstation.

#### 1. Deploy VitaraMaps on the MicroStrategy Library Server

To use VitaraMaps with MicroStrategy Workstation, ensure that the VitaraMaps plugin is deployed on the MicroStrategy Library Server that your Workstation connects to.

Follow the installation steps provided in the official documentation:\
[https://docs.vitaramaps.com/installation/libraryInstallSteps.html](https://docs.vitaramaps.com/installation/libraryInstallSteps.html)

#### 2.  VitaraMaps Locally on Workstation

In addition to the server installation, the VitaraMaps plugin must also be deployed locally on your machine.

* Go to the MicroStrategy Workstation installation folder on your local system.
* Navigate to the following path:

"**C:\Program Files\MicroStrategy\Workstation\Code\plugins”**&#x20;

* Unzip the downloaded VitaraMaps.zip file into this folder.

#### Configure MobileLibrary Server Path:

&#x20;1\. Open a web browser and navigate to the Library configuration page using the URL format below:

&#x20;**https://www.example.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/plugins/VitaraMapsLibrary/config.jsp**

(Replace “example.com” with the actual path of your Library server.)

2. On the configuration page, enter the path to your **MicroStrategy Web** application (not the Library) and click **Submit**.\
   Example: **https://\[your-web-server-path]/MicroStrategy**

(Replace this with the actual path of your Web server.)

3. Once configured successfully, the page will confirm the configuration status as shown in the screenshot.
