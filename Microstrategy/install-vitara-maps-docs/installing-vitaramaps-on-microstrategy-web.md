## Upgrading an Existing Installation

If you are upgrading an existing VitaraMaps installation, follow the steps below carefully.

### Step 1: Back Up Existing Customizations

Before upgrading, take a backup of all customization files from the existing installation.

VitaraMaps supports customization through the following files:

* **mappingLayers.txt** and its dependent files – Used to define and configure custom map layers.
* **global.txt** – Used to define color palettes, fonts, and other global configuration parameters.
* **customStyles.css** – Used to apply individual style customizations to the maps.

If you have created new custom maps that are not part of the default installation, make sure to back them up as well.

#### **File Locations:**

/webapps/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/**global.txt**

/webapps/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/**customStyles.css**

/webapps/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/**mappingLayers.txt**

_**Note**: The plugins directory should contain only one folder named **VitaraMaps**. Do not keep backup copies of the VitaraMaps folder inside the plugins directory._

### Step 2: Install the New Version

1. **Download** the latest VitaraMaps web version from the provided link.
2. **Extract** the VitaraMaps folder from the ZIP file.
3. **Stop** the Web Server (IIS, Tomcat, or equivalent).
4. **Delete** the existing VitaraMaps folder under the plugins directory.
5. **Copy** the new VitaraMaps folder into the plugins directory of your MicroStrategy Web installation.
6. **Replace** the license.txt file in the new VitaraMaps folder with the license file provided to you.

**Restore** your backup files (**global.txt, customStyles.css, mappingLayers.txt**, and all its dependent files) to the following location:\
&#xNAN;**/webapps/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/**

7. **Start** the Web Server.
8. **Clear** browser caches and access dossiers/documents from a new browser or incognito window to avoid issues related to previously cached license files.
