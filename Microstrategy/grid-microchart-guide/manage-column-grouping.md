# Manage Column Grouping

## Properties Menu - Manage Column Grouping <a href="#properties-menu---manage-column-grouping" id="properties-menu---manage-column-grouping"></a>

In the vitara grid chart, we can also group the columns which is called ‘column grouping’. Groups can be created with only attributes or only metrics or combination of both. Below screenshot shows the column groups created in the Grid chart.

In the above image, there are two column groups ‘Year\&Month’ and ‘KPIs’ of which the first group is in expanded state and the second column is in collapsed state.

The groups can be expanded or collapsed. If the group is in a collapsed state, then only the first object in the group will be shown on the chart. And the remaining objects can be seen only if the group is expanded. By default, the newly created groups will be collapsed.

### Creating Column Groups <a href="#create-column-group" id="create-column-group"></a>

Let us look into creating column groups in simple steps.

#### **Step 1:**

Open the hamburger menu of a column and hover onto Grouping, then a submenu opens. See the screenshot below

#### **Step 4:**

Now, drag and drop the objects from the left panel into the dropzone and set the group titles. In this case we are creating two groups as below:\
‘Year\&Month’ grouped with attributes ‘Year’ and ‘Month’\
‘KPIs’ grouped with metrics ‘Cost’, ‘Profit’ and ‘Revenue’.\
See the below screenshot

## Enhanced Metric Organization with Row Metric Grouping in Version 5.2.5 <a href="#enhanced-metric-organization-with-row-metric-grouping-in-version-525" id="enhanced-metric-organization-with-row-metric-grouping-in-version-525"></a>

In the latest release (version 5.2.5), we’ve introduced a powerful feature called Row Metric Grouping, allowing users to efficiently organize metrics when they are moved to rows. This functionality provides a streamlined way to group and categorize metrics based on specific criteria. To gain a deeper understanding of this feature and its benefits, explore the distinctions between Metric Grouping and Column Grouping. This comparison will guide you in optimizing your metric organization for a more intuitive and structured presentation of data.
