# Thresholds

## Properties Menu - Thresholds <a href="#properties-menu---thresholds" id="properties-menu---thresholds"></a>

Thresholds let the user highlight specific values in the chart. In the Vitara grid chart, we can apply thresholds for metrics and attributes. Attributes thresholds is implemented in 4.6.1 version. Applying thresholds is so easy in the Vitara grid chart.

### **How to open the Threshold Editor window**

We can open ‘threshold editor’ window in any of the below mentioned three ways.

### **Using the ‘Edit’ button:**

Move the cursor on the Vitara grid chart, ‘Edit’ button will appear. Click on the ‘Edit’ button to open the properties window. In the properties window select ‘Thresholds’ tab. Click on the ‘Manage Thresholds’ tab.

### **Metric:**

Select the metric on which you want to apply a threshold in ‘Metric’ drop down box.

**Select Target:**

In ‘Select Target’ drop down box select the type of threshold you want; a row or cell highlighter. For example, if I apply a threshold for Profit top 5 apply green color, using ‘Cell’ in ‘Select Target’, the threshold will display as shown in the below screenshot.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image104.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If we apply ‘Row’ in the ‘Select Target’ drop down box the same threshold will be as shown in the below screenshot.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image62 (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Select Condition:**

When you select any threshold condition, the threshold editor window will stretch into its complete view. Below is a screenshot of the full threshold editor window.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image11 (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Give all the inputs in the threshold editor window. In the ‘Value(s)’ text input box, give appropriate input value according to the threshold condition.Using ‘Background Color’ we can apply colors to the background of the text.Using ‘Color’ we can apply colors to the text where the threshold condition is true. We can show an icon along with text, in the cells where the threshold condition is true. Select any icon from the drop-down box. Apply color for the icon using the ‘Icon Color’ color input tab, and assign a size to icons using the ‘Select Size’ text input box. We can show only in the cells where the threshold condition is true. To apply this property, enable ‘Icon Only’ checkbox. After all the inputs are entered click on the ‘Apply’ tab.

Below is a screenshot of the Vitara grid chart showing the result of the above threshold on the metric - ‘Profit’.

If you want to apply another threshold condition on the same metric click on the ‘Add’ button.

## **Group:**

When grouping is applied in a Grid Chart, thresholds can be set either on individual rows or on grouped rows. The ‘Group’ field determines the level at which thresholds are applied: select _No grouping_ to apply thresholds on normal rows, or choose a grouped attribute to apply thresholds on group rows.

## Grouping Level Thresholds in Vitara Grid

In Vitara Grid, thresholds can be applied not only to individual rows but also to grouped rows when attributes are grouped. This allows you to highlight data either at the **detail row level** or at the **aggregation (group) level**.

### How It Works

When grouping is applied on any row of the Grid Chart, you can choose whether thresholds should be applied at the group row level or at the individual row (no grouping) level.

* Use the **Group** field in the Thresholds panel to select the level:
* **No grouping** → Thresholds are applied on normal (individual) rows.
* **Group** rows → Thresholds are applied on the grouped rows.

#### Example Use case

Please see the below screenshot of the Vitara grid chart, where grouping is applied on the ‘Product Category’ attribute. The default aggregation function applied is ‘Sum’.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image99.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can also apply thresholds on these group header aggregations. Open threshold editor window using any of the three possible ways: ‘Edit’ button, ‘Hamburger’ button, ‘Right click’ on the chart.Below is the screenshot of the threshold editor window. Click on ‘Add’ button to define a new threshold.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image115 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Expand the ‘Group’ drop-down box. It will show two segments, ‘No grouping’ and the attribute names on which grouping is applied. In our example, as we applied to group on the ‘Product Category’ attribute, the threshold window will show this attribute.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image43.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select ‘No grouping’ if you want to apply thresholds for normal data rows and select the attribute name, e.g. Product Category, to apply thresholds on group headers.Give all the inputs in the threshold editor window. Below is the screenshot applying thresholds on aggregation values.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image37 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Example Scenarios at Different Levels

In the screenshot below, thresholds are applied at the Year level:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Th_level1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The next example shows thresholds applied at the Category level:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Th_level2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Last Grouping Level

If no additional attribute is grouped beyond the last level:

* The last attribute in the grouping is treated as “No grouping”.
* Applying thresholds at the Sub-category level or at No grouping produces the same behavior, since both represent the last level of grouping.

### 2. Thresholds on Metrics Column

#### How It Works

* When **Metrics → Move to Rows** is enabled, a **Metrics Column** is created.
* This Metrics Column behaves like an attribute and can be placed in **Row Grouping**.
* Thresholds can then be defined at the **Metrics grouping level**, just as with any other grouped attribute.

Refer to the attached GIF file for a demonstration of how thresholds work when the Metrics Column is row grouped.

### Enhancements in 4.6.1 version <a href="#enhancements-in-461-version" id="enhancements-in-461-version"></a>

There are two enhancements in thresholds property in 4.6.1 version.\
**1. Ability to select threshold source and target.**\
2\. Ability to apply threshold on attributes.

### Ability to select threshold source and target. <a href="#ability-to-select-threshold-source-and-target" id="ability-to-select-threshold-source-and-target"></a>

In the new threshold editor window you can select source and target for a threshold. The source and target can any metric or attributes availabel in the grid. Basically, this feature allows you to apply threshold on metric using the values of other metric.&#x20;

### Attribute thresholds in Grid chart <a href="#attribute-thresholds-in-grid-chart" id="attribute-thresholds-in-grid-chart"></a>

From the 4.6.1 version of Vitara charts, we can apply thresholds using attributes.

The source and target drop down boxes in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. We can select an attribute as source and select an attribute as target then define a threshold condition. We have ‘Equal to’, ‘Not Equal to’, ‘Contains’, ‘Not Contains’, ‘Starts with’, ‘Not Starts with’, ‘Ends with’ and ‘Not Ends with’ are the attribute conditions that can be applied.

Click on the ‘Add’ tab to apply a new threshold. Select the Category attribute in Source and Target dropdowns.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/gridAttribute.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the below screenshot, Month attribute is selected in Source and Target drop downs and applied ‘Starts with’ condition with value ‘J’ and applied .svg marker. The threshold can be displayed as shown in the below screenshot.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/gridAttribute1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Thresholds Priority

When multiple thresholds are applied to the same metric, the most recently added threshold takes precedence—even if the conditions differ.

For example, if a threshold is applied to the Cost metric with a "greater than" condition and sets a background color, and then another threshold is added to the same Cost metric with a different condition that includes a text color and a marker, the chart will reflect only the styling from the most recently applied threshold.\
