## Small Multiples (column) chart <a href="#small-multiples-column-chart" id="small-multiples-column-chart"></a>

### **Description**

A small multiples (column) chart is useful for comparing distinct metric values for different category elements across (usually) a timeline in a single view. To display the metric value, all charts in the tiny multiples will use the same scale. The chart can also show absolute and relative variations from the average across all category elements.

## **Scenario planning**

Please review [mapping scenarios](../ibcs/mapping-ibcs-scenarios.md) for a better understanding of how scenario planning in VitaraCharts.

For this type of chart, the scenarios are mapped using **metrics**. So the user will need to define separate metrics (for the same set of category elements) representing each scenario. As an example, if you are looking at sales data across months and are interested in looking at how the actual and planned scenarios compare, you will have to define two metrics

* first one for the actual sales data
* second one for the planned sales data
