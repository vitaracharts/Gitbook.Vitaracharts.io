**Description**

A multi-tier column chart can be used to compare different situations (actual, planned, anticipated, etc.) over a specified time period (months in a year, several years, etc.).

**Scenario planning**

Please review mapping scenarios for a better understanding of how scenario planning in VitaraCharts.

For this type of chart, the scenarios are mapped using **metrics**. So the user will need to define separate metrics (for the same set of category elements) representing each scenario. As an example, if you are looking at sales data across months and are interested in looking at how the actual and planned scenarios compare, you will have to define two metrics

* first one for the actual sales data
* second one for the planned sales data
