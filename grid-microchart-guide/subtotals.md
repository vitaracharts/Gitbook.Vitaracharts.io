#### Subtotals <a href="#subtotals" id="subtotals"></a>

A subtotal lets you see the totals for subgroups of your report data. Vitara Grid chart shows the Subtotals when you group by any column. The subtotal functions include sum, count, minimum, maximum, average, first, last and Ratio in Vitara Grid chart.

Subtotals editor by default enables the ‘Use body styles’ option where it is shown same as body styles of the chart; and we cannot do text formattings on Subtotals. Below is the screenshot shown where ‘Use Body Styles’ is enabled.

In Subtotals editor, if we disable the ‘Use body styles’ option, you can do the text formatting options and apply background color to the Subtotals; font family, font size, bold, italic, underline, text color, font alignment and back ground color. Below is the screenshots of ‘Title formatting’ and ‘Value formatting’ of Grand totals editor.

Examples of screenshots where the text formattings and back ground colors are applied for subtotals.

#### Show pivot Metric Totals <a href="#show-pivot-metric-totals" id="show-pivot-metric-totals"></a>

To ensure Pivot Metric Totals function correctly, it is essential to have at least two attributes in the pivot drop zone. In version 5.2.6, we introduced a new feature called “Show Pivot Metric Totals.” By toggling the “Show Pivot Metric Totals” option in the Subtotal tab, you can easily view individual metric totals. This feature allows you to see the sum of each metric within the pivot, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.

This new option provides a convenient way to view data in grouped form. When the group is collapsed, the total for that group will be displayed, giving an overview of the data at a glance. This is particularly useful when working with large sets of data, as it allows for quick analysis without having to expand each individual group.

On the other hand, when the group is expanded, the individual data within that group will be shown. This allows for a detailed examination of each data point, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data set. With this option, users can easily switch between the total and individual views, depending on their specific analysis needs. The sample gif file is provided below.
