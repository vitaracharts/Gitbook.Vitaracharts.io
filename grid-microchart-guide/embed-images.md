# Embed Images

Vitara grid chart now supports image URLs as an attribute form. Once the attribute form is selected as display form, the Vitara grid chart will load the images related to URLs. Below is a screenshot demonstrating how to change the default attribute form to other attribute forms.

In the drop zone panel right click on the attribute which has image URL as attribute form and expands the “Display Attribute Form” tab. If that particular attribute has more than one form to display, then only MicroStrategy will show the option “Display Attribute Form”. Now you can see all the attribute forms available for that particular attribute. Select the form which has an image URL and deselects the other forms then click ‘OK’. Vitara grid chart will display only one attribute form at a time.
