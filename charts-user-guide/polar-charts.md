# Polar Charts

Some of the charts in VitaraCharts 4.6 can be converted to Polar charts. Line, Area, Bar, Column, Stacked Bar, and Stacked Column charts are available. Polar charts are also known as radar charts due to their usage of a radial value/category axis. When you convert a chart to a Polar chart, the X-axis becomes a circular/radial axis, and the axis values are shown along the circle. Here are some screenshots of Polar charts.&#x20;

Unlocking the potential of spider web charts with VitaraCharts is a breeze. Follow a few simple steps to effortlessly convert your existing charts into mesmerizing Polar charts. To illustrate, let’s consider the example of transforming an Area chart:

#### Enabling Polar Mode: <a href="#enabling-polar-mode" id="enabling-polar-mode"></a>

* Navigate to the respective chart’s editor.
* Locate the “Area” tab or tabs corresponding to your selected chart type(s), and activate polar mode.
* Adjust the “Inner Pane Size” to 1 to control the size of the center circle.

#### Grid Line Configuration: <a href="#grid-line-configuration" id="grid-line-configuration"></a>

* Proceed to the “Axes” settings.
* Locate the category axis settings.
* From the “Other” dropdown menu, set the grid width to your preferred thickness (e.g., 2).

#### Customizing the Value Axis: <a href="#customizing-the-value-axis" id="customizing-the-value-axis"></a>

* Within the same “Axes” settings, find the value axis.
* Set the grid line width to your desired thickness (e.g., 2) in the “Other” dropdown menu.
* Adjust the “Tick Interval” to align with the range of your dataset.

_For example,The tick interval is like the spacing between marks on a ruler. For example, if your data goes from 0 to 100 and you set the tick interval to 10, you’ll see marks every 10 units (0, 10, 20, 30, …, 100). This makes it easier to understand the scale of your data. Adjusting the tick interval based on your data’s range helps keep the chart easy to read._

#### Color Customization (if necessary): <a href="#color-customization-if-necessary" id="color-customization-if-necessary"></a>

* Visit the “Series” settings.
* Customize colors if needed using the available options.
* Utilize the color option to modify colors according to your preferences.

These steps can be applied to Line, Area, Bar, Column, Stacked Bar, and Stacked Column charts in VitaraCharts.
