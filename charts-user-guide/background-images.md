# Background Images

How to set the Vitara charts’ backdrop images.There are two ways to insert the background image:

#### Using a relative path (the image needs to be placed in VitaraCharts folder) <a href="#using-a-relative-path-the-image-needs-to-be-placed-in-vitaracharts-folder" id="using-a-relative-path-the-image-needs-to-be-placed-in-vitaracharts-folder"></a>

**Step 1:**

Copy the image which you want to set as a background for Vitara charts in the following folder.

```
Tomcat\webapps\MicroStrategy\plugins\VitaraCharts\custom\images
```

**Step 2:**

Open edit popup window, goto background tab, click on “Enable background image” checkbox.

**Step 3:**

Enter the name of the image with the extension (.png or .jpg) into the text box. Example:

Note: Image name is case sensitive.

#### Using Image URL or full path <a href="#using-image-url-or-full-path" id="using-image-url-or-full-path"></a>

We can directly copy the image web URL or full path in the text box.\
Examples:

We have options like - original/fit to chart/fill chart/custom, to make the image to fit with the Vitara chart. The opacity option can reduce the intensity of the background image on the Vitara chart. Below we can see a screenshot of Stacked Column Chart with a background image.
