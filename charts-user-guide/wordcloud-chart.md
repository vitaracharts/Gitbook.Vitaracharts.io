Vitara’s Word Cloud chart displays attribute elements on the chart, with larger metric values displayed in larger sizes. You can change the colors and size of the text in Vitara Word Cloud.

A word cloud chart is a visual representation of text data, where words are displayed in varying sizes based on their frequency or importance within the dataset. It provides a quick and intuitive way to identify key terms or trends in text-based information, making it easier to visualize and understand textual data patterns.

Metrics: 1 metric Attributes: At least 1 attribute Use as Filter Option - Available

#### Thresholds <a href="#thresholds" id="thresholds"></a>

In the business point of view, certain part of the chart needs to be highlighted to draw more attention from the desicion makers. For example, highlight the stores where total sales is greater than a specific value or highlight the top 10 products whose sales is high during last year’s winter. Thresholds are very useful objects in these use cases.

Thresholds will display some conditional formatting in a chart to highlight certain data points depending on predefined criteria.The criteria are attribute or metric qualifications. If a qualification’s expression evaluates to TRUE, the report displays the threshold. We can also include markers in thresholds.

To apply thresholds in vitara charts, hover the cursor on the chart. Vitara chart will display an ‘Edit’ button. When you click on this ‘Edit’ button the properties window will pop out. Select the thresholds tab to open threshold editor. In the window you can add a new threshold or delete any existing threshold or modify the existing threshold.

Note: As of version 4.6, we can use attributes to impose thresholds. All the measurements and attributes in the chart are listed in the source drop-down box in the threshold editing window. We can choose a source characteristic and set a threshold condition.

In the threshold editor window apply source, target, threshold condition and the other related information to set a threshold on the chart.

After giving all the inputs click on ‘Apply’ button.
