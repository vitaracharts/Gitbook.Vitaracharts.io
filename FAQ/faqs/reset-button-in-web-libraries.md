# Reset button in Web Libraries

#### What is the use of Reset Button in Web Libraries? <a href="#what-is-the-use-of-reset-button-in-web-libraries" id="what-is-the-use-of-reset-button-in-web-libraries"></a>

Have you ever made changes to your web, only to realize that those changes are not reflecting in your web library/ Ipad library app? It can be frustrating when you spend time customizing charts on your web, only to have them appear differently in your web library/Ipad library app.. But fear not, there is a solution - the reset button.

**What is the Reset Button?**

The reset button is a simple button that allows you to sync the charts from your web to your web library. By clicking on the reset button, you can ensure that the charts in your web library accurately reflect the changes you have made on your web.

**How Does it Work?**

When you make changes to your web, such as updating data or customizing the appearance of charts, those changes may not automatically be reflected in your web library/Ipad library app. This is where the reset button comes in. By clicking on the reset button, you trigger a process that syncs the charts from your web to your web library, ensuring that they are consistent and up-to-date.
